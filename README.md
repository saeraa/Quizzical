# Quizzical - JavaScript Edition

## Solo Project from Scrimba.com

### Made with React

In the [https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend](Frontend Career Path) of [https://scrimba.com](Scrimba) are many solo projects to get through, and this is one of the harder ones.\

I have modified the specifications with my own layout, color and typography.

I have also decided to completely forego the API call to the Multiple Answer Questions API provided, and instead created my own quiz with JavaScript questions. Some I've found through Googling, some I've written myself.
